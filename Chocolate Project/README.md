## User Story
```
Investing can be a daunting task for those who are new to the game.
I want to be able to predict a stocks price over the next week so that I know when is the best time to buy or sell.
A prediction based of historical data is not enough. I also want to see what the latest news on the company is and what is happening in the market through social media.
